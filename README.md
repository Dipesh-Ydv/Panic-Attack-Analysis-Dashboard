# üß† Panic Attack Analysis Dashboard (Power BI + Snowflake)

An interactive dashboard project to analyze panic attack patterns, symptoms, and influencing lifestyle factors using **Power BI** and **Snowflake**. This project helps uncover behavioral and clinical insights that can aid healthcare professionals and researchers in identifying key drivers of panic attacks.

---

## üìå Project Overview

This project explores relationships between:
- Symptoms and patient demographics
- Lifestyle factors and panic severity
- Triggers and panic attack frequency/duration

The insights are derived from real patient data stored in **Snowflake** and visualized using a series of well-designed Power BI dashboards.

## üìä Dashboards & Insights

### üîπ 1. **Symptoms Overview**

![Symptoms Overview Dashboard](./screenshots/Screenshot_1.png)

**Insights:**
- Out of 1200 patients, **Sweating** was the most frequently reported symptom.
- Over **58% of patients experience 3 or more symptoms**, highlighting high symptom co-occurrence.
- **Female and Male patients** show nearly equal distribution of symptoms, while **Non-binary patients** report symptoms at a lower rate.
- The **co-occurrence matrix** shows high overlap between **Shortness of Breath**, **Sweating**, and **Dizziness** ‚Äî often experienced together.

### üîπ 2. **Lifestyle Impact on Panic Attacks**

![Lifestyle Dashboard](./screenshots/Screenshot_2.png)

**Insights:**
- Patients with **higher exercise frequency** tend to report slightly **lower panic scores and attack frequency**.
- **Sleep duration is inversely related** to panic severity ‚Äî shorter sleep patterns are associated with higher scores.
- **Smokers and high caffeine consumers** show elevated panic scores, particularly when paired with low sleep.
- Over **50% of patients consume high caffeine**, and **27% are smokers** ‚Äî both factors are correlated with worse panic outcomes.

---

### üîπ 3. **Triggers & Frequency Patterns**

![Triggers Dashboard](./path/to/Screenshot_3.png)

**Insights:**
- **PTSD** is the most commonly reported trigger across patients.
- **Social Anxiety** leads to the **highest average panic severity**, despite not being the most common.
- Attack duration remains **fairly consistent (~25 minutes)** across different triggers.
- Patients with **stress or social anxiety triggers** tend to experience more severe attacks even if the frequency is moderate.
- The patient count is fairly distributed across known and unknown triggers, with **"Unknown" still forming the largest group**.

---

## üß† Key Learnings

- Integrated and queried data from **Snowflake** directly in Power BI using **Direct Query**.
- Built and applied **custom DAX measures** for clinical KPIs like panic severity, frequency trends, and behavioral segments.
- Created visually empathetic dashboards using **custom Power BI JSON themes**.
- Designed a **modular layout** to logically separate symptom, lifestyle, and trigger domains.
- Improved storytelling and decision-making capability in health data analytics.
